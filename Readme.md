# React Burger Maker :hamburger:
Are you hungry? You will be after this playing with this app! It's just in it's preliminary stages and doesn't quite look like
the savory burger you desire - just yet. Later, once the functionality is complete, I am going to add more realistic images for the toppings and potentially add
more options.

What kind of burger will you create? The choice...is yours!

# Installation

- `git clone git@github.com:matt6frey/react-burgers.git`
